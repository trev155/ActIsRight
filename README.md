Emulating "The Price Is Right" Games in React

## Setup
After cloning, do `npm install`, then `./runserver.sh`.

## Notes

## TODO
- CSS - create a class(es) "center-horizontally" and "center-vertically"
- refactor components into folders for each individual game

- if game has started - render the "end game", do not render start game
- if game has not started - render the start game, do not render end game

- if game has started and roll phase, render roll button only
- if game has started and guess phase, render lower and higher buttons

Emulating "The Price Is Right" Games in React

## Setup
After cloning, do `npm install`, then `./runserver.sh`.

## Notes
This is meant to be a mini project where I get to practice React.
Although I could continue to expand on this, I think I've gotten what I wanted out of this mini-project, so I'll probably move on for now.

## TODO
- Game Selection

- logic refactoring and possible improvements (especially in NumberDisplayBoard, also in InfoPanel)
- dice rolling - visuals and sound

- refactor components into folders for each individual game
- refactor css into smaller files?
- CSS styling of buttons
- CSS - create a class(es) "center-horizontally" and "center-vertically"
